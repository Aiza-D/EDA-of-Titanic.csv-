# EDA-of-Titanic.csv-
In Computer Sciences, terms like Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Data Science, have become so popular in a short duration of time because of the power these areas have. Here I am doing a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. And we all know EDA is the most important part to build a good Machine Learning or Artificial intelligence Model. 

The objective of this blog is to conduct EDA and statistical modeling on the Titanic Dataset in order to gather insights and evenutally predict who survived and why? (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived). Out of the 891 passengers that went onboard, approximately 38% of them surived where as majority 62% did not survive the disaster. In this blog I have analysed each column separately and in relation to Survived column which is the target feature here.

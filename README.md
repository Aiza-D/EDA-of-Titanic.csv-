# EDA-of-Titanic.csv-
In computer science, Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Data Science, these terms have become so popular in a short duration of time because of the power of these areas. Here I am doing a detailed EDA on the Titanic dataset. And we all know EDA is The Most important part to build a good Machine Learning or Artificial intelligence Model. The objective of this blog is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling on the Titanic Dataset in order to gather insights and evenutally predicting survior(0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived). Out of the 891 passengers that went on board the titanic, approximately 38% of them got surived where as majority 62% did not survive the disaster. In this blog I have analysed each column separately and in relation to Survived column which is the target feature here.
